# ElevateLabs-Cybersecurity-Task-4
Objective: Configure and test basic firewall rules to allow or block network traffic using Windows Firewall.
#Steps Performed to complete this task is captured in Execution_Steps_Task_4.ppt

Summary:
In this task, I worked with the Windows Firewall to define and test rules controlling network traffic. I listed the current inbound and outbound firewall rules, created a new rule to block inbound traffic on port 23 (commonly used by Telnet), and verified that this rule was working by performing a scan with Zenmap/Nmap, which showed the port was closed. After testing, I removed the rule to restore the firewall to its original state.
This activity helped me understand how Windows Firewall filters network traffic based on port numbers and protocols. I documented the configuration steps, including the verification process, and summarized how firewall rules protect systems by allowing or blocking specific traffic.

Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience configuring firewall rules in Windows.
Learned to verify the effectiveness of rules with scanning tools.
Improved understanding of how firewalls help secure networked systems.
